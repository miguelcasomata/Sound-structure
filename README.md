# Sound-structure (Final Coursework)


- INTRODUCTION

This report will detailed explain theoretical background about live coding, music programming and how to use Sonic Pi in order to be able to create my own live-coding musical piece. Furthermore, the weaknesses and strenghts of the project will be considered in order to obtain criticism about the experience.

- THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The computer has for some time been viewed as an amazingly appealing tool for making and controlling sound. Its exactness, opportunities for new tones, and potential for fantastical robotization make it a captivating stage for exploring different avenues regarding and making music. A programming language is an assortment of syntactic and semantic guidelines for indicating these directions, and in the long run for giving the interpretation from human-composed projects to the comparing guidelines PCs complete. The programming language goes about as an intermediary between human goal and the relating directions that sound good to a computer.

Live coding is a programming practice that works through the constant execution of code and in this manner incomprehensibly changes the view of traditional computer programming regarding merging structure, coding and investigating stages into one single procedure. This means that immediately putting code into action and turning out results enables a direct verification of whether a program works at all, and if the results make sense as expected or need to be modified. Melodic live coding may in this manner motivate individuals through catching the expertise of figuring out how to code their own spontaneous creations or structures.
