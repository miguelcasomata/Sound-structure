# Sound-structure (Final Coursework)


- INTRODUCTION

This report will detailed explain theoretical background about live coding, music programming and how to use Sonic Pi in order to be able to create my own live-coding musical piece. Furthermore, the weaknesses and strenghts of the project will be considered in order to obtain criticism about the experience.

- THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The computer has long been considered an extremely attractive tool for creating and manipulating sound. Its precision, possibilities for new timbres, and potential for fantastical automation make it a compelling platform for experimenting with and making music - but only to the extent that we can actually tell a computer what to do, and how to do it. A programming language is a collection of syntactic and semantic rules for specifying these instructions, and eventually for providing the translation from human-written programs to the corresponding instructions computers carry out.
